# Seedbox Data Science Application Test Analysis

In this following document, you will find the answers to the specific questions of the test.

## 1. What is the aproximate probability distribution between the test group and the control group?

The aproximate probability distribution for the test group (must call-in) is 25% and 75% for the control group (web-form).
Indeed, there are 14835 people placed in the must call-in to cancel test group and 44886 people placed in the web form test group.
The total population studied is 59721.

## 2. Is a user that must call-in to cancel more likely to generate at least 1 addition REBILL?

With the given data, we know that 44 886 web-form users do in total 3756 REBILLS. Furthermore, 14 835 call-in users do in total 3205 REBILLS. The average amount of REBILLs for web-form users is 0.08 REBILLs per user and the average amount of REBILLs for must call-in users is 0.22 REBILLs per user. If we do a substraction between the amounts, we can see that the must call-in user generate in average 0.13 more REBILLS than the web-form user. It is not 1 additionnal REBILL, but this value shows that the must call-in group helps the company make more profit, because they don't want to call to make an cancellation of their subscription.

## 3. Is a user that must call-in to cancel more likely to generate more revenues?

In total, the web-form users generate 89838.90$ and the must call-in users generate 95433.50$.
The average revenue amount is 2.00$ per web-form user and the average revenue amount is 6.43$ per must call-in user.
With this information, we can confirm that the must call-in user is more likely to generate more revenues than the web-form user.In fact, with a simple substraction, the must call-in user generate in average 4.43$ more per user than the web form test group. People don't want to call-in to cancel their subscription therefore they still have to pay (REBILLs).

## 4. Is a user that must call-in more likely to produce a higher chargeback rate(CHARGEBACKs/REBILLs)?

With the informations, we know that the must call-in users get in total 3205 rebills and 57 chargebacks.
The chargeback rate for the must call-in test group is 1.78%.
Also, we can also confirm the web-form users get in total 3756 rebills and 106 chargebacks.
The chargeback rate for this test group is 2.82%.
As we can see, it is more likely for a web-form user to have a higher chargeback rate.
We notice that web-form have 1.04% more chance to produce a higher chargeback rate. This result proves that web-form users are more prone to find a way to get their money back.
